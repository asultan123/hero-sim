# Description

A cycle accurate simulation enviornment for descriptor based address generator memory hierarchies. This repo is a refinement of the primitives available in https://github.com/Sparkles-Qemu/qemu_systemc_with_cnn_processor without the overhead of the full qemu simulation to speed up architectural exploration.
